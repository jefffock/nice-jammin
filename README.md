# Nice Jammin

## July 2022
Rewrote app to use the NextJS React framework and the MaterialUI component library. Please view [that repo](https://github.com/jefffock/nice-jammin-next) for the most up-to-date version of this web app. Thank you!

## Overview
I designed and built this CRUD app using React, JavaScript, HTML, and vanilla CSS on the front-end, and SupaBase (a PostgreSQL database) on the backend. 

I implemented client-side routing with React Router (v6).

Users can add their favorite live versions of songs, and other users can find and rate those versions. Users can also add ideas for the site.
